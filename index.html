    <h1>Hello my name is Jordan Adelman!</h1>
    <p>One topic I find very <strong style="color:green"></strongstyle>intresting</strong> in the known world is that of <strong style="color:blue">Astronomy.</strong>.
       Its a facinating subject that<br> ecompases the whole universe and affects our day to day lives far more than most think. For example on<br> the daily our one planet
       is bombarded by different forms of light that could cook our planet dry, hit by <br>asteroids and meteors and so much more.</p>
    <p>This is a link to one my <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" title="The Nasa Homepage" target="_blank">favorite website.</a></p>
